# **KetoMeals**

Keto meals is a site for a cookbook database which allows users to find recipes they can use when following a ketogenic diet. The website informs visitors of the benefits of this type of diet as well as allowing them to build their own personalised cookbook to make their lifestyle change easier. The website also allows users to view cookware products they may need from a promoted brand.

The project consists of 5 pages. When a user first visits the site, the pages available to them will be the homepage and register/login page. On registering/logging in they will gain access to the my recipes, add recipe and logout button.
 The homepage gives the user the chance to understand the types of recipes available and the aim of the ketogenic diet. The search capabilities are flexible allowing users to search either by meal type or by recipe or ingredient name. 
 The register page allows users to create an account for the site. After registering the user is directed to their profile page (my recipes), here they are invited to add a recipe, which will become available for all users to view. 
 Only the user is able to edit or delete the recipe. When browsing recipes, users can decide to add their favourites to their personal page for easy viewing. 

## **User Stories & UX**

### **Overall design**
1. Viewing several popular recipe sites gave me an idea of the styling conventions for online cookbooks.
 It is clear users only want to see an image of the recipe and name while searching. When a recipe is selected ingredients and steps are presented simply, making the recipe easy to follow. 
 Colours are minimal with most focus on the recipe images.
 Websites used for inspiration:
[BBC good food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes), [Delicious magazine](https://www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk/recipes/), [All recipes](http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipes/)

2. The color palette was created with [coolors](https://coolors.co/), I chose this palette as the lighter colours will ensure focus remains on the images. The brighter colours draw attention to important parts of the page for easy navigation and give the page more vibrancy.
